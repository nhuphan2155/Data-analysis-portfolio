# Data-analysis-portfolio

Portfolio that consists of my personal data analysis / data science projects

# Project 1: 2022 Funding Distribution across NSW Public Schools:

https://github.com/nhuphan2155/Python-2022-Funding-Distribution-across-NSW-Public-Schools

Used Python libraries such as Panda, Matplotlib, Numpy to analyze and visualize data of the distribution of government funding to public schools of NSW in 2022

The project used dataset available on the web page of NSW Department of Education. 

Data inspection and cleaning. Merged data from 3 different sources and tidied the data using Python.

Data analysed, visualised and communicated the results on Jupiter Notebook.

# Project 2: SQL-Olympics-data-analysis

https://github.com/nhuphan2155/SQL-Olympics-data-analysis

In this SQL project, using the 120 years of Olympics History dataset from Kaggle, I've done an exploratary analysis using basic to advanced SQL queries.

The raw dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/data

I used PostgreSQL, designed schema, created table and imported the CSV files to a SQL Database in my local machine to carry forward with the analysis.

I've used various SQL techniques such as JOIN, WITH...AS, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, DENSE_RANK, COALESCE, CROSSTAB (PIVOT TABLE)

# Project 3: Chlorophyll-a index is affected by the presence of Trichodesmium at Great Barrier Reef

https://github.com/nhuphan2155/RStudio-data-analysis

The aim is to find out if there is change in chlorophyll-a level during the presence of Trichodesmium blooms, resulting in changing water quality in the ocean at Great Barrier Reef.

Used R Studio with tidyverse library to perform Initial Data Analysis and cleaning.

Used visualisations to check normality and equal variance assumptions. Transformed data and perform the check again.

Performed hypothesis testing on transformed data to calculate the significance of key results on samples and conclusions.

# Project 4: SQL-Movies-data-analysis

https://github.com/nhuphan2155/SQL-Movies-data-analysis

In this project, I used data of the Internet Movie Database (aka IMDB). This database has information about movies, TV series, actors, directors, etc.

I've used various SQL techniques such as JOIN, CREATE VIEW, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, AGGREGATION ...
